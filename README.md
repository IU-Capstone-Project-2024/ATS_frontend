## Overview

The ATS project aims to develop an automated trading system that leverages machine learning algorithms to predict market trends and make informed trading decisions. The project consists of a frontend web interface and a backend machine learning component.

The frontend component is responsible for the direct implementation of the web interface. It serves as the business card of the project, where important information about updates, rules of our open-source business model, and comparative statistics on trading efficiency are published through interactive dashboards, tables, and graphs.
